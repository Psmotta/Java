### Source of Knoledge

* PUC Minas - Software Egineering, subjects like: 

    * AED II - Algorithms and Data Structures II
    
    * SO - Operational Systems
    
    * TIS - Interdisciplinary Software Work
    
    * PM - Modular Programming
    
    * & others...
    
    
### Knowledge with Projects

* Basics
    
    * Class, object, attributes, methods, new, identifiers, access modifiers, and primitive types;   
    * Constructor, this, get and set, encapsulation, and auto generate (constructor, get, set and methods);    
    * Exception handling, data input and output, and file reading;    
    * Loops and repetition structures such as for, for each, while and do while;    
    * Vectors and arrays;    
    * String and functions - toLowerCase, toUpperCasse, trim, substring, replace, indexOf, lastIndexOf and split;   
    * Wrapper Class - Character, Double, Boolean, Integer and others.
  
* Research Methods (At PUC the codes were implemented without using a ready-made library)
    
    * Sequential;   
    * Iterative and recursive binary.
    
* Sorting/Classification Methods (At PUC the codes were implemented without using a ready-made library)

    * Comparation;   
    * Selection Sort;    
    * Bubble Sort;    
    * Insertion Sort;
    * Shellsort;
    * Merge Sort;
    * Heapsort;
    * Quicksort.
    
* Queue, Stack and List (At PUC the codes were implemented without using a ready library)

    * With vector (some circulars);
    * Implemented through Self-Referenced Structures (cells);
    * Linear and doubly linked list.
    
* Binary Search Trees

* Hash table

* Modular Programming

    * Software quality;
        * External: Correctness, robustness, extensibility, reusability, compatibility, integrity and verifiability;
        * Internal: Readability, intelligibility, maintainability and modularity.
    * Class relationship.
        * Association, Aggregation and Composition.
        
* Inheritance and Polymorphisms

    * Super class / Expert class / extends;
    * Override;
    * Abstract classes / extends;
    * Final classes;
    * Interface / Implements.
    
* UML

    * Use Case Diagram;
    * Class Diagram;
    * Activities Diagram;
    * State diagram;
    * Component Diagram.

* Enumerables (enums)

    * Constant group.

* TDD with JUnit

    * Test-driven development;
    * JUnit Jupiter.
